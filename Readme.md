An activity tracker program to calculate the number of times your hands move up and down.
It uses mediapipe and opencv libraries.
It takes care of following things : 
    1) One round is calculated if your hands move from bottom to top and again to the bottom.
    2) If your hands are not straight the program will discard that moment.
This is still in development and I will be adding many more activities.
